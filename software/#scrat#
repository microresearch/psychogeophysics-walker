A recent example study conducted at the University of

 Sussex (Pattern
Recognition in a Bucket) takes the terms of the LSM quite literally,
making use of the waves produced on the surface of water to
pre-process date and assist in certain speech recognition tasks.

At the same time, the more general terms of a "state machine," with an
obvious nod towards political machinery, signify a methodology for
describing situations and systems, in terms of states, and transitions
between states. The behaviour of any system so described can be
simulated, and thus predicted.
